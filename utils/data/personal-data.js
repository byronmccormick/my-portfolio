While my background includes adventures in outdoor education and working with special needs children, these days I'm all about crafting clean, efficient code at AbodeBooking.  I'm a passionate learner and constantly seeking ways to improve my skills. I am currently seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.",
